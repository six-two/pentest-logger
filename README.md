# pentest-holper

A simple tool to make pentesting easier:

## ⚠️ Deprecation

Deprecated in favor of [shell-command-logger](https://github.com/six-two/shell-command-logger), which is a tool for loging rbitrary commands.
Turns out it is really hard to properly write wrappers for each tool and parse their command line arguments correctly.


## Goals
- Per project settings
- Log and search the output of your tools
- Set a proxy once, use it in all your tools
- Presets for load settings (like nmaps -T<X> and --min-rate, sqlmaps --threads, etc)

## Installation

### pip dependencies

Install them with `python3 -m pip install --user <package>`:

- jsonmerge
- pyyaml

## Tools to add
- ffuz
- gobuster
- sqlmap
- curl
- host
- whois
